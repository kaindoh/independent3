#introduction:
The project objective is to upgrade MTN Cote d'Ivoire technology infrastructure for its mobile users in Ivory Coast. 

##Activities:
I first merged each day dataset with the cell geo dataset. This was to link each day dataset with its geographical properties
After getting the three merged dataset, i concatenated them in terms of columns to get one big dataset
I cleaned the combined dataset as a whole
I found the commonly used cities using logical count method within the three days
I found the cities that were commonly used during business hours and home hours using logical operators and ~ to mean not.
